During the period 2020-2023, annual losses exceeded some EUR 50 billion. Looking at individual events, the flood in August in 2023 in Slovenia caused direct and indirect damages that are estimated at about 16% of the national GDP. </p><p>A conservative estimate is that worsening climate impacts could reduce EU GDP by about 7% by the end of the century. The cumulative additional reduction in GDP for the EU as a whole could amount to EUR 2.4 trillion in the period from 2031 to 2050, if global warming goes more permanently beyond the 1.5 degrees threshold of the Paris Agreement. For costs linked to specific weather extremes, estimates value the costs of droughts to be EUR 9 billion per year and those of floods to be more than EUR 170 billion in total since 1980. In the future, annual damages in Europe from coastal flooding could exceed more than EUR 1 trillion by 2100, with 3.9 million people exposed to coastal flooding every year (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52024DC0091" rel="noopener">European Commission Communication &quot;Managing climate risks - protecting people and prosperity&quot;, 2024</a>). </p><p>The scale of potential damages also risks further impacts on the competitiveness of economies and companies, geopolitical landscape (e.g., global safety, security, trade flows and economic stability), workforce and deepening social inequalities. </p></div></div></div></div><div id="d302d4ee-85d4-43e5-8cdb-c608e51d4c98" class="accordion ui primary"><div aria-expanded="false" role="button" tabindex="0" class="title accordion-title align-arrow-right"><i aria-hidden="true" class="ri-arrow-down-s-line icon"></i><span>What can the EU and its Member States do address these risks? </span></div><div style="height:0;overflow:hidden" aria-hidden="true" class="rah-static rah-static--height-zero"><div style="transition:opacity 500ms ease 0ms;-webkit-transition:opacity 500ms ease 0ms;opacity:0"><div class="content"><p>The EU and its Member States have already made considerable progress in understanding the climate risks they face and in preparing for them.
